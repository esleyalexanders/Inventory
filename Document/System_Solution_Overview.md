# System Solution Overview: ERP Automation for Manufacturing & Inventory

## 1. Vision & Objective

Automate and digitize the entire order-to-delivery process, eliminating manual spreadsheets, emails, and ad-hoc communications. The system will provide real-time visibility, automated planning, and seamless collaboration across all departments and with outsource vendors.

## 4. Automated Business Flow (To-Be)

1. **Customer Order Intake**
   - Customer PO entered or uploaded via portal/API.
   - System validates data, checks customer status, and triggers planning.

2. **Automated Order Analysis & Planning**
   - System checks finished goods, semi-finished, and component stock in real time.
   - If in-house can meet demand, auto-generate production plan.
   - If not, system auto-suggests outsourcing and generates vendor RFQ/PO.
   - Material available date and delivery date calculated automatically.

3. **Procurement & Outsourcing**
   - System sends digital RFQ/PO to vendors.
   - Vendor confirms lead time and delivery via portal/email/API.
   - System updates plan and notifies relevant users if delays or issues.

4. **Production Execution**
   - Digital work orders for in-house and outsource jobs.
   - Material picking, production progress, and QC tracked in system.
   - Outsource partners update status and delivery via portal/API.

5. **Inventory & Quality Management**
   - All receipts, issues, and transfers logged in real time.
   - QC results entered or uploaded; system blocks non-conforming stock.
   - Automated alerts for low stock, delays, or quality issues.

6. **Shipping & Invoicing**
   - System generates pick/pack lists, shipping docs, and triggers invoice on shipment/delivery.
   - Customer notified automatically with tracking and documentation.

7. **Reporting & Dashboards**
   - Real-time dashboards for management, operations, and finance.
   - Automated daily/weekly/monthly reports and exception alerts.
