   - Unit of Measure (pieces, m³, liters, kg, etc.)
   - Supplier Information (primary & alternate suppliers)
   - Lead Time (supplier delivery time in days)
   - Maximum Order Quantity per shipment
   - Unit Cost (standard/current price)
   - Minimum Stock Level (reorder point)

**Business Rules**:
- Each component must have at least one approved supplier

   - BOM Code (finished product identifier)
   - BOM Name & Description
   - Component List with required quantities per unit
   - Production Time per unit (hours/minutes)
   - Daily Production Capacity (units per day)
   - Quality specifications
   - Routing information (production steps)

**Business Rules**:
- BOM must include ALL components needed for one finished product
- Production capacity considers 8-hour shifts, overtime capabilities
- Quality specs define acceptance criteria

### 1.3 Packaging Master Setup

   - Enter opening balances into system (F2.1)
   - Validate quantities against records
   - Set initial stock status (Available/On-Hold)

2. **Inventory Validation**
   - Reconcile physical vs. system quantities
   - Investigate and adjust discrepancies
   - Establish cycle counting procedures

**Business Rules**:
- All inventory must be quality-approved before marking "Available"
- Damaged or questionable stock marked "On-Hold" for inspection

---

## **PHASE 3: CUSTOMER ORDER PROCESSING**

### 3.1 Purchase Order Receipt & Validation
**Process Steps**:
1. **Order Entry** (F3.1)
   - Receive customer PO (email, fax, portal)
   - Enter order details into system:
     - PO Number (customer reference)
     - Customer Information
     - Order Date
     - Requested Delivery Date
     - BOM items and quantities
     - Special packaging requirements
     - Payment terms
     - Shipping instructions

2. **Order Validation**
   - Verify customer credit status
   - Confirm BOM codes exist in system
   - Validate quantities and pricing
   - Check delivery date feasibility (preliminary)

**Business Rules**:
- Orders require customer approval before processing
- Minimum order quantities may apply per BOM
- Rush orders require management approval

### 3.2 Order Fulfillment Analysis
**Process Steps** (F3.2):

1. **Finished Goods Availability Check**
   ```
   For each BOM in order:
   - Check current finished goods stock
   - If Available Stock >= Order Quantity → Reserve stock
   - If Available Stock < Order Quantity → Calculate shortage
   ```

2. **Production Requirement Calculation**
   ```
   For each BOM with shortage:
   - Required Production = Order Qty - Available Stock
   - Round up to minimum production batch size
   ```

3. **Material Requirements Planning (MRP)**
   ```
   For each BOM requiring production:
   - Explode BOM to component requirements
   - Calculate total component needs:
     Component Need = BOM Qty × Component per Unit
   - Check component availability:
     Available = Current Stock - Reserved Stock
   - Calculate component shortage:
     Shortage = Required - Available
   ```

4. **Material Available Date Calculation**
   ```
   For each component with shortage:
   - If component has supplier → Lead Time = Supplier Lead Time
   - Material Available Date = Today + Lead Time + Safety Buffer
   - Overall Material Date = Latest component date
   ```

5. **Production Schedule Calculation**
   ```
   Production Start Date = Material Available Date
   Production Time = (Total BOM Qty ÷ Daily Capacity) + Setup Time
   Production Complete Date = Start Date + Production Time
   ```

6. **Delivery Date Proposal**
   ```
   Packaging Time = 1-2 days
   Shipping Time = Based on customer location
   Proposed Delivery = Production Complete + Packaging + Shipping
   ```

**Decision Matrix**:
- ✅ **Can meet requested date**: Accept order with confirmation
- ⚠️ **Close to requested date**: Propose alternative (±3 days)
- ❌ **Significantly late**: Negotiate new delivery date
- 🚨 **Cannot fulfill**: Recommend alternative products or partial shipment
